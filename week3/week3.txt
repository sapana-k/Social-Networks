strong triad closure property = if i have 2 strong friends, they are gonna have some kind of friendship

local bridge = no common friends, connects one cluster to another, is a weak tie

embeddedness = no. of common friends between 2 people

Structural holes happen when less embeddedness is there and one can only access the other cluster through one person, who monopolises on it, so that gap between 2 communitites is a structural hole.
structural holes refer to gaps between non-redundant contacts in a social network, acting as bridges for diverse information and opportunities
Brokerage = having holes

social capital = benefit u get from the connections/friendship in a network
which friendship to do to maximize social capital

Between = an edge has high betweenness if more path between 2 nodes pass through that edge
higher the betweenness, more it connects 2 communities/clusters/components that otherwise will not be connected

Communities = more intranet connections, less internet connections
